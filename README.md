# The Things Network node

This repository gives a simple demonstration on how to configure a Sodaq One node and monitor its data, sent over The Things Network, in a Cayenne dashboard. Since the chosen configuration of the node is lightweight (GPS is turned off), the node is also suitable for The Things Network coverage monitoring with the TTN mapper by setting a short time delay between sending signals and using a smartphone with mobile data and GPS enabled.
